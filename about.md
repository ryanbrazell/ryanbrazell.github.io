What is cop shit? Check out Jeffrey Moro's article, <a href="https://jeffreymoro.com/blog/2020-02-13-against-cop-shit/" target="_blank">Against Cop Shit</a>.

I research surveillance in higher education. Tired of not having specific answers about what makes a particular company, tool, or practice terrible, I started this site as a reference. It's full of depressing and enraging information. You shouldn't read it. Consider yourself warned.

My focus is education technology, where the cop shit is particularly egregious because it happens on a scale and with an ease that other pedagogical practices generally do not. That said, any higher education cop shit is fair game. Even yours and mine.
